# Binary segmentation examples

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

In this vignette, we show how to use atime for continuous integration
testing. We begin by cloning a github repository of an R package which
already has atime CI code.

```{r}
tdir <- tempfile()
dir.create(tdir)
git2r::clone("https://github.com/tdhock/binsegRcpp", tdir)
repo <- git2r::repository(tdir)
git2r::checkout(repo, branch="another-branch")
```

The code below is the atime test suite of the binsegRcpp package:

```{r}
inst.atime <- file.path(tdir, "inst", "atime")
test.lines <- readLines(file.path(inst.atime, "tests.R"))
cat(test.lines, sep="\n")
```

We can run the atime CI code in that package via:

```{r}
options(repos="http://cloud.r-project.org")
result.list <- atime::atime_pkg(tdir)
tests.png <- file.path(inst.atime, "tests_all_facet.png")
knitr::include_graphics(tests.png)
```

The figure above shows four columns of panels from left to right, one
for each test defined in the binsegRcpp package. The column panels are
sorted so that the first one on the left is the most likely to have a
speed regression. In detail they are sorted by `P.value` of difference
between HEAD and min time at the largest `N` which was tested in all
versions. The differences can be interpreted as follows:

* For `DIST=poisson` there is no difference in computational
  requirements between the three versions (neither time nor memory).
* For `DIST=l1` there is a constant time slowdown in HEAD, which you
  can see because there is some difference for small `N`, but not much
  for larger `N` (timings about the same). In other words, the
  slowdown happens outside of a for loop over `N`.
* For `DIST=meanvar_norm` there is a constant *factor* slowdown, which
  you can see as a small difference for small `N`, and a constant
  amount of separation on the log-log plot for large `N` (slopes about
  the same).
* For `binseg_normal` the HEAD code has larger computational
  requirements, for both time and memory, as can be seen by the larger
  slope (difference grows with `N`).
